P4 scenarios
------

#### Overview
Scenarios are intended to be run with P4 switch emulator. Each scenario consists
of P4 program `<scenario>.p4`, commands passed to switch during tests
`commands.txt`, script with tests `test.py`.

#### Dependencies

* [P4 switch emulator](https://github.com/p4lang/behavioral-model)
* [P4 compiler](https://github.com/p4lang/p4c)

Compiler is expected to be installed system-wide (make install allows that).

Switch emulator installation directory is expected to be set in
`SWITCH_EMULATOR_PATH`.

#### Running tests
To run the tests, you need to specify switch emulator directory into required
environmental variable, then compile the sources with `make` and run `make test`
(super-user privilegies may be required).
